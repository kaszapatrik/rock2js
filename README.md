This is my version of Rockstar language transpiler to JS code; I made that without any library or extension.
It's not a perfect transpiler, just a fast remake of the original.
My motivation to create this application is that the original compiler are ~14 MB, and you need Node and NPM to can use.
This is not perfect, but it is ~20 kilobyte (the .js file only 12, and it's not minified).

Use and enjoy!
